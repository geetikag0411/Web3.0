In this project i have created 4 classes namely account_balance,lender(derived class of account_balance),borrower, account(which is a friend class of both lender and borrower).'account_name' and 'account_number' are common details in lender and borrower.

Class borrower has amount_of_loan, interest_rate,number_of_payments,payments_paid,a(account) as its data members,and are private which means can be accessed within the class(purpose of these data members are pretty clear from there name).'borrower(int amount_of_loan_, int interest_rate_, int number_of_payments_)' is a parameterised constructor.set_account_name,set_account_number,set_amount_of_loan,set_number_of_payments,payment_per_month,payment_paid,
number_of_payments_to_be_paid,amount_to_be_paid are member functions.(purpose of these members functions is pretty 
clear from there name).

Class lender is the derived class of account_balanc, which stores the current balance and has virtual function balance to return balance.a(account),money_to_lended,duration_in_months are the data members and set_account_number,set_money_to_lended, 
set_duration_in_months, set_account_name, balance are the member functions.
(for details of main function run the program :))
